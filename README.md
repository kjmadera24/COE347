# COE347 Class Projects
This repository contains projects for the course COE347: Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics. Each project addresses numerical simulations of fluid flow phenomena, understanding of the practical aspects of computations, stability and
accuracy of numerical methods in the context of fluid flow simulations, ability to understand and interpret simulation results, and application of computational methods to solve practical fluid mechanics problems.

## OpenFoam1: OpenFOAM Lid-Driven Cavity Flow Simulation

This project folder contains files and data for simulating the lid-driven cavity flow using OpenFOAM and Paraview. The simulations are performed on various mesh grids and Reynolds numbers to study the behavior of the flow.
